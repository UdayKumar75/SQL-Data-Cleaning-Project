# 🏠 Nashville Housing Data Cleaning Project

This project involves cleaning and preparing housing data from Nashville for further analysis or visualization. The main work is done using SQL to demonstrate data transformation and cleaning techniques.

## 📁 Project Files

- `Nashville Housing Data for Data Cleaning1.csv` - Raw dataset used in this project.
- `Housing Data Project.sql` - SQL script containing all data cleaning steps.

## 🔧 What This Project Covers

- Handling null values
- Standardizing date formats
- Breaking out address components
- Removing duplicates
- Updating column values for clarity

## 💡 Objectives

The goal of this project is to practice SQL data cleaning skills using a real-world dataset and prepare it for downstream analysis such as visualizations, dashboards, or statistical modeling.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- SQL (tested on [your DBMS, e.g., MySQL / PostgreSQL / SSMS])
- CSV dataset (raw data)

## 🏁 How to Use

1. Clone the repo.
2. Open the SQL file in your preferred SQL editor.
3. Make sure the CSV is imported into your SQL environment.
4. Run the script step-by-step to see how each cleaning task is performed.

## 📈 Future Work

- Visualization of cleaned data using Power BI / Tableau / Excel
- Predictive modeling using cleaned dataset
